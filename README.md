# Functional Pokering

Collection of tools for investigating poker hands, odds, equity and other things to teach myself Haskell.

# Motivation

I am an experienced developer who wants to learn Haskell for fun and profit. I have looked at Haskell before but never had time to really immerse myself in it.

There are projects I might want to use it for commercially and so I need more than Project Euler problems to learn where the bodies are buried in terms of complexity, performance, functionality.

This collection of libraries/tools is in a domain I understand that provides problems in terms of algorithms, IO and optimisation.

# Status

 * Cards exist and have IO functions to present them neatly in the terminal
 * Decks can be created and shuffled
 * Hold Em hands can be created and ranked (mostly)
 * Hold Em hand shape can be determined
